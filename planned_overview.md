# Planned overview of the website

- Home
	An overview of the entire garden and all its content. Should be used as a navigation page.
- Projects (or garden areas)
	Projects are part of the garden. I.e. garden themed areas, like vegetable patch or root cellar, that themselves can contain smaller sub-projects. The projects will also be linked with the GitHub page.
- Blog 
	The blog (or news page) of the current status of the different projects.  
- About the garden
	A description of what the goals of the project are.
- About me
	A self promotion page.
