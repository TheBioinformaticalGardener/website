## The central dogma of biology
* DNA
* RNA
* Protein

There is a principle in biology called *"the central dogma of (molecular) biology"*. I would say it is a major simplification of the extreme complexity of biology, although it gives the briefest of explanations for how all life functions. The central dogma says that DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes proteins. Although in this formulation it seems like a unidirectional sequence it must be stressed that proteins are involved in all steps from production of DNA, RNA, and other proteins. This situation is reminiscent of the "chicken or the egg" problem. What came first DNA or proteins. The most likely answer is neither, as RNA has been suggested as the original molecule for the genetic sequence.  

## The genetic sequence
All living organisms are based on the genetic code of DNA. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of the four nucleic bases adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). It is quite remarkable to think that all life are based on just these four components, stacked one after each other, in an unique combination for each being. 

**The gene and its connection to the protein**
A gene is a sequence of the entire DNA. A given gene encodes for a given protein. A living organism consists of so much more than these two components, but in the briefest of explanations, we can say that the genes are the recipes for the proteins, that themselves are the tools that create the body.
