## The central dogma of biology
* DNA
* RNA
* Protein

There is a principle in biology called *"the central dogma of (molecular) biology"*. I would say it is a major simplification of the extreme complexity of biology, although it gives the briefest of explanations for how all life functions. The central dogma is as follows; that DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes proteins. Although in this formulation it seems like a unidirectional sequence it must be stressed that proteins are involved in all steps from production of DNA, RNA, and other proteins. This situation is reminiscent of the "chicken or the egg" problem. What came first DNA or proteins. The most likely answer is neither, as RNA has been suggested as the original molecule for the genetic sequence. No matter what, all living things (on Earth) is based on this principle.

## The genetic sequence
All living organisms are based on the genetic code of DNA. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a so called polymer, which means that it consists of multiple repetitive units. In the case of DNA the repetitive unist are nucleotides, with the four nucleobases of either Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), or Guanine (G). It is quite remarkable to think that all life are based on just these four components, stacked one after each other, in an unique combination for each being. A collection of nucleotides in a row is known as a sequence, and particular sequences of the DNA is what we refer to as genes.


**The gene and its connection to the protein**\
A given gene encodes for a given protein. A living organism consists of so much more than these two components, but in the briefest of explanations, we can say that the genes are the recipes for the proteins, that themselves are the tools that create the body. 


**Combinatorics - *How combinations of four can give life***\
Combinatorics is the mathematical field of how units can be put together to form different combinations. We will start out slow with how we can combine the four nucleobases, A, T, C, and G, in a sequence of four:

ATCG,
ACGT,
AGCT,
ACTG,
ATGC,
AGTC,
*... and at this point I have already given up listing them all ...*

The point is to show that with as few units as four it gets rather difficult (or rather tiresome) to imagine all the possible combinations. The mathematics used to figure out the number of combinations is rather simple. It is simply the factorial of the number of units. Here we have four units, therefore;
$$4! = 4(4-1)(4-2)(4-3)=4*3*2*1=24$$
So, there are 24 possible combinations of the four nucleobases.


Okay, but we can of course have repetition of nucleobases, like AATT, ACCC, or GAAA. How many sequences of three letters can we get with combinations of a the four nucleobases? The answer is the number of units raised to the power of units in the sequence; 
$$4^3=4*4*4=64$$
So, there are 64 possible combinations of the four nucleobases in a sequences of three. 

The last number can be worthwhile remembering because this is the number of available so called codons.
