# Where to start? (2025-03-31)

Like any other project, the question I now face is where to start(?).

I have many ideas in my head, but the main decision that needs to be made now is; whether to start to clear out the garden area I have been given (make the website somewhat easy on the eyes), or do I familiarize myself with the gardening tools I for sure will use. I guess it is natural to start slow and mix the two approaches.

Luckily, some of the groundwork has already been done, so hopefully something will be up and running in the near future!
