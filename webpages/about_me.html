                    I am the gardener of the Bioinformatical Garden, and my name is Marius
                    Dobbe Klemetsen.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am a biologist and have a Master's degree in cell and molecular
                    biology. At the moment I am working as a research technician/engineer
                    at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway. I am from the southern part
                    of Norway but currently living in the north of Norway, in Tromsø.
                    <br /><br />
                    During my education, I got a fondness for programming, which mixed
                    well with my interest in biology. However, I always felt that it was
                    difficult to grasp what the intersection of biology and information
                    technology actually encapsulates. This desire to explore
                    bioinformatics further lead to the creation of the Bioinformatical
                    Garden and the persona of the gardener. Like a gardener planting new
                    plants in the spring and learning what grows and what wilts during the
                    season, this website is meant to be a personal playground where I can
                    develop and showcase my skills on various topics related to
                    bioinformatics.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b><i>Master's degree in cell and molecular biology</i></b
              >, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
              in Trondheim, Norway
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><i>Bachelor's degree in biology</i></b
              >, from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, Norway
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My education consists of a broad coverage of many fields of biology
            but culminated in a more specialized field of computational biology,
            cell and molecular biology. Moreover, many of the courses taken,
            bachelor-, and master's thesis focused on areas of plant biology.
