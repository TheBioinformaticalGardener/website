Like any other project, the question I now face is where to start(?).<br><br>

I have many ideas in my head, but the main decision that needs to be made now is; whether to start to clear out the garden area I have been given (make the website somewhat easy on the eyes), or do I familiarize myself with the gardening tools I for sure will use. I guess it is natural to start slow and mix the two approaches.<br><br>

Luckily, some of the groundwork has already been done, so hopefully something will be up and running in the near future!<br><br>
