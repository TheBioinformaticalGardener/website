I am familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP) and how objects can share relationships, as well as experience with graphs as networks of entities that connect to each other. 

I have for some time been struggling with my workstation filling up with multiple tabular files that more or less share relations with each other. In these files, you will find a lot of duplicated or redundant data that is connected through weak identifiers. My wish is of course that I could whip up an app that helped me verify and keep track of all the data. Unfortunately, I am not currently at the level where that is done in a jiffy. However, I do believe I have come a bit further in that I have started to learn about SQL (Structured Query Language) and how to make your own databases. 

I am planning to set up a MySQL database that I will host locally from my Raspberry Pi 3.
Let's see if it will help me with the constant struggle of organizing my data.
