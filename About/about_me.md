# About the gardener

I am the gardener of the Bioinformatical Garden, and my name is Marius Dobbe Klemetsen.

I am a biologist and have a Master's degree in cell and molecular biology. At the moment I am working as a research technician/engineer at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway. I am from the southern part of Norway but currently living in the north of Norway, in Tromsø. 

During my education, I got a fondness for programming, which mixed well with my interest in biology. However, I always felt that it was difficult to grasp what the intersection of biology and information technology actually encapsulates. This desire to explore bioinformatics further lead to the creation of the Bioinformatical Garden and the persona of the gardener. Like a gardener planting new plants in the spring and learning what grows and what wilts during the season, this website is meant to be a personal playground where I can develop and showcase my skills on various topics related to bioinformatics.

## Public resume
### Education
* ***Master's degree in cell and molecular biology***, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway
* ***Bachelor's degree in biology***, from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, Norway

My education consists of a broad coverage of many fields of biology but culminated in a more specialized field of computational biology, cell and molecular biology. Moreover, many of the courses taken, bachelor-, and master's thesis focused on areas of plant biology.


### Experiences
* ***Programming***. My language of choice is Python but I also have experience with other languages like R, Java, and Bash. I am comfortable working from the Linux terminal. 
* ***Laboratory***. I have experience working in a laboratory from my work and education, in molecular- and microbiology projects. 
* ***Imaging techniques***. Multi- and hyperspectral imaging.
* ***Field work***. I have the Norwegian drone (UAS) license for Open-Category A1/A3.  
* ***Biological databases***. My master's thesis was within the topic of computational biology, which lead me to gain experience working with well-known databases used by biologists. This also included experience with programmatic access (using APIs) to the databases.
* ***Teaching***. I have experience teaching from various roles as an instructor, teaching kids, youth, and adults. 


### Work
* ***Department engineer***, at the Climate Laboratory, an affiliation of Arctic Marine Biology at the UiT - The Arctic University of Norway (current occupation, since July 2024)
* ***Research assistant***, at Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO), in Tromsø (seasonal, 2021)
* ***Assistant teacher***, at Vefsn Folkehøgskole - Toppen (Mosjøen, Norway) in the class of Mountaineering and Kayaking. The position also included working with promotion and media (photography, filming, and editing) for the school. (full-time, 2018/2019)
* ***Activity leader*** for various summer camps for children and youths (seasonal, 2018-2023)
* ***Assistant / Home care provider*** to adults with psychological developmental disabilities (seasonal, 2020-2022)
* ***Kayaking instructor***, the Norwegian Paddling Federation (NPF) (irregular, since 2021)
