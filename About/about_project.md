## Content
The Bioinformatical Garden is a playful attempt at describing the landscape of bioinformatics in the context of a garden. Moreover it is meant to show how I (as the gardener) develops throughout time, by establishing new garden areas and sowing new crops. My personal experience of bioinformatics is that it quite a wast field which can be difficult to grasp. This project therefore also aims to serve an educational value in that others can learn from my experiences and written content on various topics.

This webpage is a personal playground where I can write about topics I find interesting and want to learn more about. I have always wanted to make a website from scratch. I have an interest in educational content and would like to be a contributor in that community, and thereby thought that a webpage could be a suitable platform.
